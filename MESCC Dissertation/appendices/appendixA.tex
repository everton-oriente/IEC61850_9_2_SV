The dissertation template document can be adapted for the Thesis Research Plan report, using the following guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Change “Dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master’s degree in Critical Computing Systems Engineering” to “Thesis Research Plan of the Master’s degree in Critical Computing Systems Engineering”.
\item	Remove the reference to the Jury.
\item	Remove unnecessary sections such as dedication, acknowledgement, etc.
\item	The Introduction and state-of-the-art chapters can provide the initial contents of the dissertation, which can be later evolved and extended in the Thesis work.
\item	Introduce a chapter after state-of-the-art with preliminary information on the proposed approach(es) to solve the identified problem. 
\item	Provide a chapter on the research plan for the second semester, including the work methodology (with necessary reference to evaluation of the work) and the proposed timeline.
\end{itemize}
